## 📌 Overview

CodeVault is an open-source browser extension that automatically captures accepted coding solutions, extracts their metadata, organizes them into a structured GitHub repository, and keeps your coding portfolio up to date.

Instead of manually copying solutions, creating folders, generating documentation, and updating statistics, CodeVault automates the workflow after an accepted submission.

### Currently Supported Platforms

- 🟡 LeetCode
- 🟢 GeeksforGeeks
- 🔵 HackerRank

---

# ✨ Features

## 🔄 Automatic Solution Detection

CodeVault detects accepted submissions on supported coding platforms.

Simply solve and submit a problem normally. Once the submission is accepted, CodeVault processes the solution automatically.

---

## 💻 Multi-Platform Support

CodeVault currently supports:

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| LeetCode | ✅ Supported |
| GeeksforGeeks | ✅ Supported |
| HackerRank | ✅ Supported |
| Codeforces | 🚧 Planned |
| CodeChef | 🚧 Planned |
| AtCoder | 🚧 Planned |

---

## 📦 Solution Extraction

CodeVault automatically extracts submitted source code from accepted solutions.

Supported languages depend on the platform and detector implementation.

The repository structure is designed to support multiple programming languages independently.

---

## 🧠 Metadata Extraction

CodeVault extracts and maintains metadata such as:

- Problem name
- Problem slug
- Difficulty
- Platform
- Programming language
- Tags
- Pattern
- Topic
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Solved date
- Submission information

---

## 📄 Automatic README Generation

Every synchronized solution can receive its own documentation.

Example:

```text
Two Sum

Difficulty: Easy
Platform: LeetCode
Language: Java

Problem Statement
...

Approach
...

Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
````

CodeVault also automatically generates a repository-level portfolio README.

---

## 📊 Portfolio Statistics

The Repository Engine automatically generates coding statistics from the solution index.

Statistics include:

* 🏆 Total problems solved
* 🔵 Basic problems
* 🟢 Easy problems
* 🟠 Medium problems
* 🔴 Hard problems
* 🌐 Platform statistics
* 💻 Language statistics
* 🧩 Pattern statistics
* 📚 Topic statistics
* 🕒 Recently solved problems
* 🔥 Coding activity

No manual README editing is required.

---

## 🔥 Coding Activity Heatmap

CodeVault v1.4.0 introduces an automatically generated GitHub-compatible coding activity heatmap.

Generated at:

```
.codevault/activity.svg
```

The heatmap represents coding activity across the latest 365 days.

Activity intensity is deterministic:

| Daily Solutions | Activity     |
| --------------: | ------------ |
|               0 | No activity  |
|               1 | Light        |
|               2 | Medium-light |
|             3–4 | Medium       |
|              5+ | Highest      |

The heatmap is generated from solved-date information stored in:

```
.codevault/index.json
```

---

## 🔐 GitHub OAuth Authentication

CodeVault uses GitHub OAuth authentication.

Users do not need to manually create or manage a Personal Access Token for the normal synchronization workflow.

---

## 🚀 Automatic GitHub Synchronization

After an accepted submission, CodeVault can automatically:

```text
Accepted Submission
        ↓
Detect
        ↓
Extract Solution
        ↓
Extract Metadata
        ↓
Generate Documentation
        ↓
Build Repository Package
        ↓
Update Repository Index
        ↓
Generate Portfolio
        ↓
Generate Activity Heatmap
        ↓
Commit
        ↓
Push to GitHub
```

---

## 🛡️ Duplicate Detection

CodeVault prevents previously synchronized solutions from being committed again.

A unique fingerprint is generated for synchronized solutions and checked against existing repository data.

---

# 📁 Repository Organization

Solutions are automatically organized by platform, language, difficulty, and problem.

Example:

```
Repository
│
├── LeetCode
│   └── Java
│       └── Easy
│           └── Two-Sum
│               ├── Solution.java
│               └── README.md
│
├── GeeksforGeeks
│   └── C++
│       └── Basic
│           └── Array-Problem
│               ├── Solution.cpp
│               └── README.md
│
└── HackerRank
    └── Java
        └── Easy
            └── Java-Problem
                ├── Solution.java
                └── README.md
```

The exact generated path can be configured and managed by the repository engine.

---

# 🧠 Repository Engine

The CodeVault Repository Engine manages repository-level coding data and documentation.

```text
.codevault/
├── index.json
└── activity.svg
```

The solution index acts as the source of truth for repository statistics.

The Repository Engine uses this information to generate:

* Portfolio README
* Difficulty statistics
* Platform statistics
* Language statistics
* Pattern statistics
* Topic statistics
* Recently solved problems
* Coding activity heatmap
